Java Stream API provides primitive specializations of Stream for the primitive types 
int, long and double. 
The primitive type streams available in Java are-
1) IntStream– This is the int primitive specialization of Stream.
2) LongStream– This is long primitive specialization of Stream.
3) DoubleStream– This is the double primitive specialization of Stream.

Ways to create primitive streams -
1) empty()
2) of(int n) and of(int... n)		// same for long and double 
3) range(int startInclusive, int endExclusive)
4) rangeClosed(int startInclusive, int endInclusive)
5) Arrays.stream()

Stream has higher order function called forEach to which we call first class function - Consumer Interface implementation as lambda
